## Dixis E-commerce Platform Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

The platform is divided into the following microservices:

1. **API Gateway**
   - Entry point for all client requests
   - Handles routing to appropriate services
   - Implements rate limiting and security measures

2. **Authentication Service**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - JWT token management
   - User profile management

3. **Product Service**
   - Product catalog management
   - Search and filtering
   - Category management

4. **Order Service**
   - Order processing
   - Payment integration (Stripe)
   - Order status management

5. **Shipping Service**
   - Shipping rate calculation
   - Integration with shipping providers
   - Tracking management

### Infrastructure

1. **Database Layer**
   - MongoDB with replica set for high availability
   - Sharding configuration for horizontal scaling
   - Regular backups and monitoring

2. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis cluster for distributed caching
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting

3. **Search Engine**
   - Elasticsearch for full-text search
   - Product catalog indexing
   - Analytics and reporting

### Scaling Strategies

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Kubernetes auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
   - Load balancing across service instances
   - Database sharding for data distribution

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Multi-level caching (application, database)
   - Cache invalidation patterns
   - Redis for distributed caching

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - CDN for static assets
   - Image optimization and lazy loading
   - API response compression

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Prometheus for metrics gathering
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Custom dashboards for key metrics

2. **Logging**
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack
   - Log aggregation and analysis
   - Error tracking and alerting

3. **Health Checks**
   - Liveness and readiness probes
   - Service dependency monitoring
   - Automated recovery procedures

### Security Measures

1. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - JWT authentication
   - HTTPS encryption

2. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Secure communication between services
   - Regular security audits

### Deployment Strategy

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Rollback procedures

2. **Environment Management**
   - Development, staging, and production environments
   - Configuration management
   - Secret management

### Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular database backups
   - Cross-region replication
   - Recovery procedures

2. **High Availability**
   - Multi-zone deployment
   - Service redundancy
   - Automated failover
